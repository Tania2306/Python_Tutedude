**ASSIGNMENT 3 - TASK 1**
def => keyword to define a function.
factorial(n) => name of fucntion along with parameter that represents user input.
res = 1 => initialises variable res to 1.
for i in range(1, n+1) => defines range for i from 1 to n+1 (n is the user input) for which the loop will run.
res *= i => updates the value of res from (res)  to (res * i) each time the loop runs.
return res => gives the output as final value of res.
num => variable assigned to store user input.
print() => prints the output.
factorial(num) => calls the user-defined function funtion.

**ASSIGNMENT 3 - TASK 2**
import maths => accesses the built-in library in Python that contains mathematical functions and constants.
num => takes a number as user input.
math.sqrt(num) => accesses square root function from math library and operates on num.
math.log(num) => accesses logarithm function from math library and operates on num with base e.
math.sin(num) => accesses sine function from math library, operates on num and gives the answer in randians.
