**ASSIGNMENT 1 - TASK 1**
The program uses if-else conditional statement to check if the input number is even or odd.
input() => takes a single number as input and stores it in variable n
int() => converts the input number to data type int
if => executes a code statement if the given condition is true
esle => executes another code statement if the given condition is false
n%2==0 => condition that checks if the remainder obtained when n is divided 2 is equal to 0

**ASSIGNMENT 2 - TASK 2**
the program uses for loop to calculate the sum if numbers between 1 to 51.
sum=0 => declares the initial value of variable sum as 0
i => loop variable
for i in range() => specifies the values through which i gets iterated.
sum+=i => the value of sum gets updated from sum to sum+i every time the loop runs with a new value of i.
